Day 2 â€“ JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers (Variables & Data Types)

1) What are variables in JavaScript?
Answer: Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, variables can hold different data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, objects, etc.

2) What are the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript?
Answer:
- var: function-scoped, can be redeclared and reassigned, hoisted.
- let: block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope, introduced in ES6.
- const: block-scoped, must be initialized at declaration, cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

3) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Answer:
- Scope: var is function-scoped, let/const are block-scoped.
- Redeclaration: var can be redeclared, let/const cannot.
- Reassignment: var and let can be reassigned, const cannot.
- Hoisting: var is hoisted and initialized as undefined, let/const are hoisted but in Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

4) What are JavaScript data types?
Answer:
JavaScript has 8 main data types:
- Primitive: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol (ES6), BigInt
- Non-Primitive: Object (includes Arrays, Functions, etc.)

5) What is the difference between null and undefined?
Answer:
- undefined: a variable declared but not assigned a value.
- null: an intentional absence of any value (set manually by the programmer).

6) What does the typeof operator do?
Answer: The typeof operator is used to determine the data type of a value or variable.

Example:
typeof "Hello"; // string
typeof 123;     // number

7) Why does typeof null return "object"?
Answer: This is a long-standing bug in JavaScript. Ideally it should return "null", but for historical reasons it returns "object".

8) What is the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?
Answer:
- Primitive: store single values (immutable, stored by value).
- Non-primitive: store collections of data (mutable, stored by reference).

9) Can you reassign values to let and const?
Answer:
- let: Yes, can be reassigned.
- const: No, once assigned it cannot be reassigned.

10) Give an example showing var hoisting.
Answer:
console.log(x); // undefined (due to hoisting)
var x = 10;

11) What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?
Answer: TDZ is the time between when a variable is hoisted and when it is actually declared. Accessing a let or const variable in TDZ results in a ReferenceError.

12) Is JavaScript dynamically typed or statically typed?
Answer: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime and can change.
