Answer:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of content using tags.

6️⃣ What is the difference between id and class?

id → Unique (used once per page).

class → Reusable (can apply to multiple elements).

Cross Question:

Which has higher CSS specificity?
👉 Answer: id has higher priority than class.

7️⃣ What is the difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements?

Answer:

Inline → Doesn’t start on a new line (<span>, <a>).
