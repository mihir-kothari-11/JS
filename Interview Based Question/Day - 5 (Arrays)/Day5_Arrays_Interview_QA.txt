Day 5 - JavaScript Arrays Interview Q&A

1️⃣ What is an array in JavaScript?
Answer: An array is a special variable that can store multiple values in a single variable. Each value is called an element, and each element has an index (starting from 0).

2️⃣ How do you create an array in JavaScript?
Answer:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
let numbers = new Array(10, 20, 30);

3️⃣ How do you access the first and last element of an array?
Answer:
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(arr[0]);              // First element (10)
console.log(arr[arr.length - 1]); // Last element (40)

4️⃣ What are common methods used with arrays?
Answer:
- push(): Add at the end
- pop(): Remove from the end
- unshift(): Add at the beginning
- shift(): Remove from the beginning
- indexOf(): Find the index of element
- includes(): Check if element exists

5️⃣ What is the difference between push() and unshift()?
Answer:
- push(): Adds an element to the end of an array.
- unshift(): Adds an element to the beginning of an array.

6️⃣ How do you loop through an array in JavaScript?
Answer:
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}
for (let num of arr) {
   console.log(num);
}

7️⃣ How do you find the length of an array?
Answer:
let arr = [10, 20, 30];
console.log(arr.length); // 3

8️⃣ How do you check if an element exists in an array?
Answer:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
console.log(fruits.includes("banana")); // true
console.log(fruits.indexOf("apple"));   // 0 (found at index 0)
