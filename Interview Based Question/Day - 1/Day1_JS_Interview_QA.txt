Day 1 – JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers

1) What is JavaScript?
Answer: JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, scripting language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. 
It runs in the browser (client-side) but can also run on the server using Node.js.

2) What is the difference between JavaScript and Java?
Answer:
- Java is a compiled, object-oriented programming language used for standalone applications.
- JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language mainly used for web pages.
- Despite the similar names, they are completely different.

3) Where is JavaScript mainly used?
Answer:
- Client-side (in browsers): for dynamic web pages, form validation, event handling.
- Server-side (via Node.js): for building APIs, servers, and backend logic.

4) What is the role of a JavaScript Engine?
Answer: The JavaScript Engine is built into browsers (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox). 
It parses, compiles, and executes JavaScript code.

5) How do you add JavaScript to an HTML page?
Answer:
- Inline:
<script>
  alert("Hello World");
</script>

- External file:
<script src="script.js"></script>

6) What is the difference between inline and external JavaScript?
Answer:
- Inline: Written directly inside <script> tags in HTML.
- External: Stored in a .js file and linked using <script src="file.js"></script>.
External is better for reusability and cleaner code.

7) What are alert(), prompt(), and console.log() used for?
Answer:
- alert(): Shows a popup message to the user.
- prompt(): Asks for user input in a popup.
- console.log(): Prints messages in the browser console (used for debugging).

8) What is the difference between console.log() and alert()?
Answer:
- console.log(): logs messages to developer console (not visible to users).
- alert(): shows a popup directly to the user.

9) What is DOM in JavaScript?
Answer: DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML documents. 
It represents the page as a tree structure of objects, so JavaScript can access and modify HTML elements (e.g., change text, styles, or attributes).

10) Give an example of changing an HTML element using JavaScript.
Answer:
<h1 id="title">Hello</h1>
<script>
  document.getElementById("title").innerText = "Hello from JS!";
</script>

11) What is Node.js?
Answer: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows running JavaScript code outside the browser. 
It is built on Chrome’s V8 engine and is used for server-side applications.

12) What is the difference between running JS in a browser vs Node.js?
Answer:
- In browser: JS is mainly used for DOM manipulation, UI interactions, and fetching data.
- In Node.js: JS is used for backend tasks like handling requests, reading/writing files, and working with databases.
